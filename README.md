# image-manipulation
This is the first Take-Home Programming exam for CSC 215 - Programming Techniques. 

This program reads in an image and will perform an operation base on the user's input. if "--sharpen" is given the program will perform the sharpen operation. Same follows with "--smooth", "--contrast", "--grayscale", "--negate", and "--brighten". The program will also convert the image to binary or ascii given what option the user gives. (Either "--ascii" or "--binary") After performing the operation the program will write out the new modified image.
